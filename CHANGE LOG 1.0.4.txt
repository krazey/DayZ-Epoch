[ADDED] Placing a plot pole now creates a preview of the "safe" build area protected by the plot pole. This is only viewable 
        by the plot owner, will disappear upon logout, and is only re-creatable by re-placing the plot pole @dayz10k @vos

[FIXED] More Localization (translations).  @dayz10k, @VeryBigBro (Russian), @JoSchaap (Dutch), @Geodar (Czech), @krazey (German)
[FIXED] Fixed incorect spelling of chainsaw name was horlite needed to be hermlite. @vbawol

[CHANGED] All copper prices have been changed to 2 silver to buy, 1 silver to sell @dayz10k
